I'm completing a bacherlor's degree in mathematics with computer science. I see my training in abstract math as a means to get better at thinking about applied, practical problems. Some of my not-as-theoretical interests are in decision theory, game theory and AI safety.

On the side I play [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) competitively at the top ~10 level in Europe. I have also spent a significant amount of time teaching and lecturing on the game. 

I spend much of my energy on thinking about my thinking. I find that most written content on technical topics fails to capture the human thought process behind mathematical and scientific rigour. As such (some of) my writing tries to make my internal thought process as legible as possible to the reader.
