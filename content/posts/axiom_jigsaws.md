## Intro
I recently came across the 'Foundations of the Theory of Probability,' a 1933 paper by A.N. Kolmogorov which outlines the 'canonical' formalization of probability theory which we know and love today. I took a probability course last semester and expected the content to be very similar. It was therefore surprising and delightful to find that the foundational axioms given by Kolmogorov are *substantively* different from the ones I am used to.

In this post I analyze the subtly fascinating differences between these axiomatizations. I take apart the systems by removing and adding axioms to understand what role they have in the system. The goal ultimately is to understand the reasoning and historical context behind different choices of axioms, and to see how different jigsaw pieces come together to make more or less the same image of probability theory.

On a more meta level, I'm interested in the mental motion of playing jigsaw with axiom ~

## The axioms

First of all, I'll as concisely as possible 

Let $ (\Omega, \Alpha) $ be a measurable space.
