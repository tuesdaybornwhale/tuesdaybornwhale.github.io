As AI continues to improve at writing and math-based tasks, it seems plausible that it either has or soon will surpass even domain experts in these tasks. While I usually think of the progress of AI from the perspective of safety, alignment and security concerns, this post aims to explore a different topic: to what extent can superhuman AI in a domain instruct and empower humans to improve for themselves? 

The paper [Superhuman artificial intelligence can improve human decision-making by increasing novelty](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214840120#supplementary-materials) (Shin et. al), published in 2023, explores precisely this question. The authors choose to examine these impacts through the game of go, which was famously conquered by computers back in 2016. More importantly, they point out that open-source superhuman models have been widely available since 2017, along with interactive UI's that allow players to learn from the models' choices. This makes go an interesting candidate to examine the extent to which access to a superhuman entity can help humans evolve and improve. 

As a case study, go is particularly close to my heart as I am myself a competitive go player and regularly use open-source models for practice and game reviews. It is my domain knowledge that leads me to disagree with the conclusions of the paper that there is evidence that humans play better than in the pre-AI era. I think their own data should be interpreted as suggesting that go AI has a minimal impact on human performance, and I'd like to argue why here because it's a conclusion which I think is only natural if you have the context of being at least a stronger amateur player. At the end, I'll also zoom out and discuss AI's relationship to human improvement from my personal experience in the competitive scene.

### Discussion on Shin et. al

To understand why I think this article's conclusions are unjustified, it's important to lay out what the collected data is, and why the authors think it supports the conclusion stated in the title: that superhuman AI *can* improve human decision-making.

The paper uses a database of over one-hundred thousand expert games, which is almost exclusively composed of games from players with the professional title. 

They measure the development of 'decision quality' (DQ) and 'novelty' in expert games between 1950 and 2021. They observe that both decision quality and novelty have both statistically increased ever since the advent of AI.  Moreover, the authors run a regression analysis which finds a significant positive correlation between the novelty of a move and its decision quality. This, the authors feel, justifies the thesis of the paper - that human decision quality has improved due to AI, and that it has specifically improved because players have become more creative and more novel.

Their measure of novelty will also be important for the rest of this post, because Shin et al. uses it in various forms to justify and explain some of their other findings.

The DQ of a human move k is a score given to it based on how much worse it is (according to AI) than the favourite AI move. Using the following formula:

$$ DQI(a_{k}^{human}) = 100 - (Q(s_{k}, a_k = a_{k}^{AI}) - Q(s_{k}, a_k = a_\\{k}^{human})) $$

where $a_{k}^{human}$ is the action (move) chosen by the player, $a_{k}^{AI}$ is the optimal choice given by AI, and $Q(s_{k}, a_{k}) \in [0, 100]$ is the 'Q-value' usually referred to by go players as the 'win-rate' of a move $a_k$ from the state $s_k$. The qualitative meaning of the formula is that a human move that matches the AI will get a DQ score of 100, whereas a human move which doesn't match the favourite AI move will have its DQ penalised by however worse it was than the 'optimal' AI decision.

In the appendix to this paper, the researchers justify using previous work that the metric is a 'good' metric, in that it robustly seems to hold up against several sanity checks. For example, it distinguishes clearly between human and AI play, and can differentiate an expert from an expert who is cheating with an AI. I think this metric more or less measures what its supposes to measure, and while there *is* an issue I have with its definition, this is only important for some remarks at the end.

The novelty of a game is defined (suspiciously) simply by Shin et. al. It is simply sixty minus the move number which featured the first move that had never previously been seen. As we will discuss below, this notion of novelty adapts badly from chess into go due to several features of go which aren't at all obvious to people unfamiliar with the game.

A very similar variant of DQ was already introduced in a 2020 paper. It was noted that according to the metric, human expert performance had improved, but only up to move 60. The researchers use this finding to only consider human play until move 60 in the 2023 paper. This decision makes the research less interesting for a go player. This is because the first sixty moves are almost never decisive and rarely even give players any meaningful advantage. Most of the early game in high-level play is filled with pre-determined theoretical variations ('joseki') that players learn by heart. In a typical tournament game, I will have to make no more than five to ten decisions before move 60, and these decisions are much, much less important on average than those made later in the game. For a go player, then, the natural way to interpret the data is that players have not improved in the key stages of the game (post move 60), but have only improved their score in the early game as they are memorising the AI's favourite variations. This explanation clashes with the authors' conclusions, and while they test this 'memorisation' hypothesis in several ways to discard it, I'll discuss why I find none of the rebuttals convincing.

Shin et al. suggest that if memorisation were a good explanation for increases in decision quality over time, then this increase would no longer be statistically significant for moves after a player *deviates* from optimal AI choices or plays a novelty. Moreover, according to them, if memorisation explained the increase in quality, then this increase would drop off 'later' in the game. They remark that none of these effects occur: their DQ metric still shows statistical improvement in all of the specific cases.

I argue that all of these tests actually *completely miss the point*, and this is because their premise fundamentally misunderstands how memorisation works in the game of go. In chess, the entire board position is important to the next decision, and the limited board size makes memorisations of entire board positions both feasible and sensible. Moreover, chess has fewer decisions and mistakes tend to be more punishing. Consequently, asking how a player reacts to a novel full-board position, or how they react to later positions which they're unlikely to have memorised, are meaningful things to do.

Conversely, in go, the center of the board tends to be empty and unimportant during the early game, as players take the corners and sides of the board first. As such, memorising whole board variations just isn't something people do in go at all. Instead, they memorise local variations (josekis) in important sub-regions. While global thinking in go is important, it only becomes complex or crucial way later into the game where memorisation is absolutely infeasible, and as a consequence there exists almost no notion of a 'full-board variation' in go. This means that while a board position on move 25 is technically novel 99% of the time, in the sense that the exact position has never before been observed, expert players at that stage still play the game entirely on autopilot by using their memory to play *local* variations which do not meaningfully interact with each other in the early stages of the game.

This means that the paper's idea of looking at player behaviour after a 'novelty' just doesn't translate to go: the *overwhelming* majority of those 'novel' decisions are still made in completely normal board positions where all local variations are memorised by both sides, and in my mind there is no evidence that these decisions are in any way less memorised that previous ones.

The other thing that the researchers seem to misunderstand is that in the early game, there are almost always more than ten moves that are essentially equally favoured by both AI and humans, and moreover humans will be aware more or less of what the AI's equally favoured choices are. It follows that when a move which isn't the AI's top option is played by a human early in the game, so long as it's still one of the top ten moves, the opponent is likely already familiar with that move in a local (joseki), and can and do respond based on local moves which are still memorised. 

In general, it's *extremely easy* for expert go players to make decisions which are approved by AI in the early game, as they can rely on their memory and experience to navigate familiar local positions with little effort. This is why player performance according to the researchers' decision quality index drops off *after* move 60, as local positions become both more complex and more interconnected. This is also why their argument based on the maintained improvement in decision quality in 'later' (moves 20-60) is equally flawed. Since it is not justified that experts are playing meaningfully novel positions during this part of the game, it becomes pointless to examine how decision quality varies between move 15 and move 30. While Shin et. al recognise in the appendix that their notion of novelty is a bit too simple for go, they underestimate just how misleading it can get, and how thoroughly it puts their thesis into question.

### So... we aren't getting better?

If you had asked me before whether humans are getting measurably better at go in the modern era, I would have said 'probably a little bit'. I'm hence surprised and frankly a bit discouraged that human play after move sixty, in the relevant part of the game, hasn't gotten any better since AI became available. Even worse, the way I'm most compelled to interpret the 'improvements' seen before move 60 is that humans can copy patterns suggested by AI in the early stages, but don't understand them well enough to play them out any better in the key parts of the game. Expert humans' median interaction with AI may well be superficial pattern memorisation that doesn't translate to meaningful understanding.

One explanation for humanity's apparent stagnation may be that access to AI can *hurt* some players; I'll illustrate this with an example. A while ago I met an old acquaintance of mine on an online go server. He was a stronger amateur player, but still weaker, for example, than my strongest students and thus extremely far away from the top level of play. I was surprised to find that his rank on the online server was the highest possible, on par with that of active professionals. He credited his improvement entirely to AI, and explained to me in detail how he claimed he was studying with AI.

After our conversation, I checked out his games to find, unsurprisingly, that he was clearly cheating. Every. Single. Game.

This example is one of many I have found of cheaters who seem to believe that even if they're consulting a superhuman AI while playing, they still have agency over which moves they play and in some sense are both still 'themselves' playing and learning. This is, of course, cope. When cheaters consult an AI during their games, they tend to default to always playing its top suggested moves because their opinions are deeply influenced by the AI's superior suggestion. The human is effectively disempowered, having no independent thoughts of their own, and the computer makes all the decisions.

I claim that this type of disempowerment is most pronounced in cheaters, as they tend to cheat because they're already lazy in the first place. However, I think it's a danger to anyone who chooses to study with AI: I feel myself fighting against it every time I turn on my AI on my computer.

These are hardly original observations. It is common to critique systems and the people within them for encouraging or participating in superficial learning that involves, for example, copying or memorising theory or problem solutions with no active, curious engagement.  I rather would like to highlight how disturbing it is that the structural habit of human disempowerment may be leading us to empower AI over ourselves. It's the lamest version of cyborgism.
### How do we *actually* get better?

While the data doesn't seem to suggest that humans are improving on average, I am familiar with specific individual players who have clearly used AI to learn and improve. One question I'm working on answering, then, is what separates a successful AI user and learner from an unsuccessful one?

### Appendix: a technical remark on decision quality

If my above claim that game-critical decisions are made after move 60, then why does Shin et al. [2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15035), which introduces an almost identical variant of the Decision Quality metric, show clearly that the difference between human and AI moves is the largest between moves 30 and 60? I think the explanation for this lies in the way DQ is defined. Recalling the definition:
$$DQI(a_{k}^{human}) = 100 - (Q(s_{k}, a_k = a_{k}^{AI}) - Q(s_{k}, a_k = a_{k}^{human})$$
we see that this is a linear function in terms of the drop in the Q-value ('win-rate'). However, a drop in win-rate is not at all a linear indicator of move quality, as is illustrated by the following example. On an empty board, my home computer gives white a 60% win-rate if 'komi' is 7.5, but gives white a 44% win-rate if 'komi' is 6.5. This means that early in a game, mistakes that drop your expected score by one point will often lose you between 10% and 20% in win-rate. Consequently, fluctuations of win-rates between 30% and 70% are totally normal in high-level games, even if the mistakes players are making are small and insignificant for human play. Contrasting this with a position where one side has a win-rate of 10%, it is first of all impossible for them to make a mistake which is 15% worse than the optimal decision, but it is additionally the case that they must make much worse moves that lose many more points to lose any win-rate at all. This is intuitive if you interpret the Q-value as an estimation of your winning chances. When the game is really close, a one-point mistake may be the difference between a win and a loss. However, if one side is already at a huge advantage, one-point 'mistakes' are not really relevant anymore. 

Since games tend to have more extreme win-rate differences towards their finish (as there is a clear likely winner), the DQ measure systematically over-estimates the importance of human mistakes in the early stages of the game. 

I would like to make clear that this 'flaw' in DQ as a metric isn't that problematic if you're comparing moves played at the same stage of the game, as in that case an '8% mistake' will have a comparable meaning in both cases. I think its rather problematic as a measure to compare decision quality of moves played at different stages of the game, where an '8% mistake' can mean vastly different things.
