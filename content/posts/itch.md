"Did I forget something?"

I pad my coat for wallet, keys and phone. For the third time that day, I remove my backpack and fumble inside for my boarding pass - just in case the last few times were fruits of the imagination. The itch subsides as I close my bag, but it is hardly returned to my back before it comes again:

"Did I forget something?"

This time, I choose not to scratch. After all, it would be ridiculous, almost embarassing to check again. The itch persists, but eventually I barely notice it fading as I busy myself going through security and finding my gate. By the time we're boarding, the itch is all but forgotten in a background of pleasant music and happy expectations. In a distracted, delicious daze, I remove my headphones to parse what the lady checking my boarding pass says.

"ID card, please?"
