      <description>old notes (maybe useful)
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll go over various types of monstrous companions which help us think about math.
Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s axiom One principle I find helpful for thinking about systematic change is Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s fence. Suppose you happen upon a fence in a field. It appears to have no purpose, so you may consider simply removing the useless fence. However, Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s argument suggests that you shoud be careful about removing seemingly useless fences in seemingly innocent fields.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Did I forget something?&amp;rdquo;
I pad my coat for wallet, keys and phone. For the third time that day, I remove my backpack and fumble inside for my boarding pass - just in case the last few times were fruits of the imagination. The itch subsides as I close my bag, but it is hardly returned to my back before it comes again:
&amp;ldquo;Did I forget something?&amp;rdquo;
This time, I choose not to scratch.</description>

      <title>The Weierstrass Function, or Falling out of Love with Wikipedia</title>

      <description>While writing my post on mathematical monsters, I researched the history of the Weierstrass function, an early example of a pathological function which was everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable. While the bulk of my historical research was not to relevant to the content of the main post, I still thought it was interesting enough to discuss in a separate piece. In particular, I want to reflect on what I would describe as dissapointing writing choices by wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s editors, which would have misled my impressions of the discussion between mathematicians at the time, had I not checked the sources for myself.</description>

      <description>Introduction: axiomatizing natural numbers In math, we often define objects whose existence and properties seem obvious and common place. For example, many introductory university level courses will go out of their way to define the natural numbers. As mundane as this process can seem, I like the mental motion of formalizing such obvious objects. I see at as a sampling of our sub-conscious: a brief taste of the contents of our minds that rarely, if ever, exit the world of the murky and implicit.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Anytime someone finds a problem with your axioms, you just say &amp;ldquo;oh, but of course that&amp;rsquo;s not what I meant,&amp;rdquo; and you change the axioms.&amp;rsquo; - cool math prof
Intro I recently came across the &amp;lsquo;Foundations of the Theory of Probability,&amp;rsquo; a 1933 paper by A.N. Kolmogorov which outlines the &amp;lsquo;canonical&amp;rsquo; formalization of probability theory which we know and love(?) today. I took a probability course last semester and expected the content of Kolmogorov&amp;rsquo;s paper to be very similar to what I had learned.</description>

      <description>Test Post does this actually work?
$$ E=mc^2 $$
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$

      <description>Introduction Math genealogy is a pretty cool mental motion I discovered that helps me think about math in ways that are both fun and insightful.
